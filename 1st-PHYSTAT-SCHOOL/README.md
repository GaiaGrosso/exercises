This exercise was prepared for the [1st PhyStat School of Statistics](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1537633/).
It is a revisitation of the GitHub code in [NPLM-GOF](https://github.com/GaiaGrosso/NPLM-GOF). 
This illustrative example is discussed in depth in [SciPost Phys. 16, 123 (2024)](https://scipost.org/SciPostPhys.16.5.123) and in the [lecture's slides](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1537633/contributions/6801315/).
